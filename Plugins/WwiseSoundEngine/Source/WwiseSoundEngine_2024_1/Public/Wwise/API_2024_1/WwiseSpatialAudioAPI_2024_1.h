	/// @name Basic functions. 
	/// In order to use SpatialAudio, you need to initialize it using Init, and register the listeners that you plan on using with any of the services offered by SpatialAudio, using 
	/// RegisterListener respectively, _after_ having registered their corresponding game object to the sound engine.
	/// \akwarning At the moment, there can be only one Spatial Audio listener registered at any given time.
	//@{

	/// Initialize the SpatialAudio API.  
	virtual AKRESULT Init(const AkSpatialAudioInitSettings& in_initSettings) override;

	/// Assign a game object as the Spatial Audio listener.  There can be only one Spatial Audio listener registered at any given time; in_gameObjectID will replace any previously set Spatial Audio listener.
	/// The game object passed in must be registered by the client, at some point, for sound to be heard.  It is not necessary to be registered at the time of calling this function.
	/// If not listener is explicitly registered to spatial audio, then a default listener (set via \c AK::SoundEngine::SetDefaultListeners()) is selected.  If the are no default listeners, or there are more than one
	/// default listeners, then it is necessary to call RegisterListener() to specify which listener to use with Spatial Audio.
	virtual AKRESULT RegisterListener(
		AkGameObjectID in_gameObjectID				///< Game object ID
		) override;

	/// Unregister a game object as a listener in the SpatialAudio API; clean up Spatial Audio listener data associated with in_gameObjectID.  
	/// If in_gameObjectID is the current registered listener, calling this function will clear the Spatial Audio listener and
	/// Spatial Audio features will be disabled until another listener is registered.
	/// This function is optional - listener are automatically unregistered when their game object is deleted in the sound engine.

	virtual AKRESULT UnregisterListener(
		AkGameObjectID in_gameObjectID				///< Game object ID

	/// Define a inner and outer radius around each sound position for a specified game object. 
	/// The radii are used in spread and distance calculations, simulating a radial sound source.
	/// When applying attenuation curves, the distance between the listener and the inner sphere (defined by the sound position and \c in_innerRadius) is used. 
	/// The spread for each sound position is calculated as follows:
	/// - If the listener is outside the outer radius, then the spread is defined by the area that the sphere takes in the listener field of view. Specifically, this angle is calculated as 2.0*asinf( \c in_outerRadius / distance ), where distance is the distance between the listener and the sound position.
	///	- When the listener intersects the outer radius (the listener is exactly \c in_outerRadius units away from the sound position), the spread is exactly 50%.
	/// - When the listener is in between the inner and outer radius, the spread interpolates linearly from 50% to 100% as the listener transitions from the outer radius towards the inner radius.
	/// - If the listener is inside the inner radius, the spread is 100%.
	/// \aknote Transmission and diffraction calculations in Spatial Audio always use the center of the sphere (the position(s) passed into \c AK::SoundEngine::SetPosition or \c AK::SoundEngine::SetMultiplePositions) for raycasting. 
	/// To obtain accurate diffraction and transmission calculations for radial sources, where different parts of the volume may take different paths through or around geometry,
	/// it is necessary to pass multiple sound positions into \c AK::SoundEngine::SetMultiplePositions to allow the engine to 'sample' the area at different points.

	/// @name Helper functions for passing game data to the Reflect plug-in. 
	/// Use this API for detailed placement of reflection image sources.
	/// \aknote These functions are low-level and useful when your game engine already implements a geometrical approach to sound propagation such as an image-source or a ray tracing algorithm.
	/// Functions of Geometry are preferred and easier to use with the Reflect plug-in. \endaknote
	//@{

	/// Add or update an individual image source for processing via the AkReflect plug-in.  Use this API for detailed placement of
	/// reflection image sources, whose positions have been determined by the client, such as from the results of a ray cast, computation or by manual placement.  One possible
	/// use case is generating reflections that originate far enough away that they can be modeled as a static point source, for example, off of a distant mountain.
	/// The SpatialAudio API manages image sources added via SetImageSource() and sends them to the AkReflect plug-in that is on the aux bus with ID \c in_AuxBusID. 
	/// The image source applies all game objects that have a reflections aux send defined in the authoring tool, or only to a specific game object if \c in_gameObjectID is used.
	/// \aknote The \c AkImageSourceSettings struct passed in \c in_info must contain a unique image source ID to be able to identify this image source across frames and when updating and/or removing it later.  
	/// Each instance of AkReflect has its own set of data, so you may reuse ID, if desired, as long as \c in_gameObjectID and \c in_AuxBusID are different.
	/// \aknote It is possible for the AkReflect plugin to process reflections from both \c SetImageSource and the geometric reflections API on the same aux bus and game object, but be aware that image source ID collisions are possible.
	/// The image source IDs used by the geometric reflections API are generated from hashed data that uniquely identifies the reflecting surfaces. If a collision occurs, one of the reflections will not be heard.
	/// While collision are rare, to ensure that it never occurs use an aux bus for \c SetImageSource that is unique from the aux bus(es) defined in the authoring tool, and from those passed to \c SetEarlyReflectionsAuxSend.
	/// \endaknote
	/// \aknote For proper operation with AkReflect and the SpatialAudio API, any aux bus using AkReflect should have 'Listener Relative Routing' checked and the 3D Spatialization set to None in the Wwise authoring tool.
